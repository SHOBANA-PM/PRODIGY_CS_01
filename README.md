# PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher Implementation 🔐

## 💼 Internship
**Domain:** Cyber Security  
**Company:** Prodigy InfoTech  
**Task 1:** Implement Caesar Cipher

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It replaces each letter in the message with a letter fixed positions down the alphabet.

## 💻 Features
- Encrypts and decrypts user-input text
- User specifies the shift key

```
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter shift value: 3
Type 'encrypt' to encrypt or 'decrypt' to decrypt: encrypt

Result: Khoor Zruog
```

## 📂 Files
- `caesar_cipher.py` → Python program file
- `README.md` → This file (project explanation)

## 📌 How to Run
- Run using any Python environment:
  ```
  python caesar_cipher.py
  ```

## 🚀 Outcome
This task helped me understand basic encryption techniques and how user input can be processed securely using Python.
